### IN PRAISE OF SUNDIALS. 

WHAT an antique air had the now almost effaced 
sun-dials, with their moral inscriptions, seeming 
coevals with that Time which they measured, and 
to take their revelations of its flight immediately from 
Heaven, holding correspondence with the fountain of light! 
How would the dark line steal imperceptibly on, watched 
by the eye of childhood, eager to detect its movement, never 
catched, nice as an evanescent cloud, or the first arrests of 
sleep ! . , . 

Ah ! yet doth beauty like a dial hand 

Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived ! 

What a dead thing is a clock, with its ponderous 
embowelments of lead and brass, its pert or solemn dulness 
of communication, compared with the simple altar-like 
structure and silent heart-language of the old dial ! It 
stood as the garden god of Christian gardens. Why is it 
almost every where vanished ? If its business-use be super- 
seded by more elaborate inventions, its moral uses, its 
beauty, might have pleaded for its continuance. It spoke of 
moderate labours, of pleasures not protracted after sunset. 

Charles Lamb. — Essays of Elia.

IN PRAISE OF SUNDIALS, 

HOW well the skilful gardener drew, 
Of flowers and herbs, this dial new ! 
Where, from above, the milder sun 
Does through a fragrant zodiac run : 
And, as it works, the industrious bee 
Computes its time as well as we. 
How could such sweet and wholesome hours 
Be reckon'd, but w^ith herbs and flowers ? 

Andrew Marvell. — The Garden.

A DIAL is the Visible Map of Time, till Whose Invention 
'twas follie in the Sun to play with a Shadow. It is 
the Anatomic of the Day and a Scale of Miles for the 
Jornie of the Sun. It is the silent Voice of Time and without 
it the Day were dumbe ... It is ye Book of ye Sun on which 
he writes the Storie of the Day. Lastly, Heaven itself is but 
a generall Dial, and a Dial it, in a lesser volume. 

Robert Hegge. — Heliotropum Sciotherictim {1630),

IN PRAISE OF SUNDIALS, 

METHINKS it were a happy life . . . 
To carve out dials quaintly point by point, 
Thereby to see the minutes how they run ; — 
How many make the hour full complete ; 
How many hours bring about the day ; 
How many days will finish up the year. 
How many years a mortal man may live. 
When this is known then to divide the times ; — ... 
So minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years, 
Pass'd over to the end they were created. 

Shakespeare. — Henry VI. (3 part), Act ii., Scene 5. 

THE sundial is a thing of deep sentiment. All feel the 
beauty and wonder of the thought that Time, that 
most intangible, most fleeting, most wonderful of 
conditions, is marked so fittingly in its passing by a 
shadow almost equally intangible ; and the noblest evidences 
of creations — the stars in the heavens — would be to us 
invisible and unknown save for their revelation through the 
shadow of the earth. 
Mrs. Alice Morse Earle. — Sun-dials and Roses of Yesterday.

IN PRAISE OF SUNDIALS. 

THE hours when the mind is absorbed by beauty are the 
only hours when we really live, so that the longer we 
can stay among these things so much more is snatched 
from inevitable Time. Let the shadow advance upon the 
dial — I can watch it with equanimity while it is there to be 
watched. It is only when the shadow is not there, when the 
clouds of winter cover it, that the dial is terrible. The 
nvisible shadow goes on and steals from us . . . These are 
the only hours that are not wasted — these hours that 
absorb the soul and fill it with beauty. 

Richard Jefferies. — The Pageant of Summer. 

THERE is always, to my thinking, a charm about a sun- 
dial . . . The sacred grey of the aged stone, mellowed 
by the many years of sun and rain, forms a 
fair ground for the patterns which our loved lichens have 
traced upon it, in dark and orange, gold and oxydised silver . . . 
The Dial seems a witness with a silent voice, amid the 
changes of this life, to the lastingness of things. 
The Author of The Harvest of a Quiet Eye. — On Sundials.

" A good idea, well carried out. Mr. Hyatt not only knows his 
modern writers about the garden — Mrs. Earle, Miss Jekyll, Canon 
Ellacombe, Dean Hole, and the rest of them — passing well, but he 
knows the ancients also. The anthology is very full and well chosen." 
— Country Life. 



" For those garden lovers who require a Birthday Book, Mr. 
Alfred H. Hyatt has produced exactly the right thing, a dainty 
volum.e in the form of a Garden Calendar and Anthology, the extracts 
being taken from the Poets and many modern writers whose works on 
the subject are well known." — Yorkshire Post. 



" From first to last it is sweet, fragrant, and delicately arranged. 
To the lovers of flowers we can scarcely imagine any Birthday Book 
more acceptable, ... It forms the first volume in a new series 
especially devoted to garden lovers, and if succeeding issues are any- 
thing like as good as this there need be little apprehension about its 
success." — The Publishers' Circular
