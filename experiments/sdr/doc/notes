gqrx - general purpose radio spectrum analyzer

---

I'm having some trouble getting audio to work on gqrx.
It's working and I'm getting audio from an FM station (91.7 in Ithaca)
using Mode `WFM`.
Recording (using the `Rec` button under the audio section) creates
a `.wav` file that captures the appropriate audio.


There's an option to push the audio through UDP (also in the `Audio`
section).
I don't see where to change it but the default port is 7355.

From [here](https://gqrx.dk/doc/streaming-audio-over-udp#more-157),
this works to play:

```
nc -l -u 7355 | aplay -r 48k -f S16_LE -t raw -c 1
```
