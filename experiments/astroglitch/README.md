Experiments with "natal chart".

What I think is happening is that each of the planets (maybe mapped to names of the zodiac?)
are mapped to an angular location at each relevant time.

The times are:

* Birth date (month, day, year), birth time (hour, minute)
* Place of birth (country, city/town or lat/lon)
