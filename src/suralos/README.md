Work on creating an overworld map for "children of solarus".

Data files and tilemap images taken from [Children of Solarus](https://www.solarus-games.org/games/children-of-solarus/) ([gl](https://gitlab.com/solarus-games/games/children-of-solarus)).

Everything should be libre/free licensed (Solarus assets are CC-BY-SA 4.0).

There's still some problems with stitching on the sides, where some shadows don't appear (under the bridge) and some trees are screwed up.

I'm not sure how much is my fault and how much is the maps fault. I assume it's mine but the squished trees make me worried.
