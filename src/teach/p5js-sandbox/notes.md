Notes
===

There are five major styles:

* oblong circle
* oblong circle within circle whose perimeter is joined by lines
* region filled with oblong circles
* region filled with 'space filling' (small) circles
* region filled with rotationally symmetric circles

Filled in regions can be considered degenerate cases of lines.

`potrace` and `autotrace` can be used to automate conversion from image files
to svg files.

`p5.js` *can* be used to create SVG directly but needs it's own package.

See [p5.js-svg](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg).
