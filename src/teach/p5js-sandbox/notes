There are five major styles:

* oblong circle
* oblong circle within circle whose perimeter is joined by lines
* region filled with oblong circles
* region filled with 'space filling' (small) circles
* region filled with rotationally symmetric circles

Filled in regions can be considered degenerate cases of lines.
