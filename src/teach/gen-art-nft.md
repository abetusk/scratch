Generative Art NFT
===

A class where beginner to intermediate students would
create a piece of generative art and then put it up on
an NFT site for sale.

Subject to availability, demand and ability, a 'gallery' could
be tried for at the end of the class where each student
can show their (digital) art and even potentially allow
people to purchase it, either directly through some NFT
site or using us as a proxy buyer.

The focus would be on creating a Javascript piece of generative art,
maybe with a standard library like p5.js, that could be run in the browser.
Part of the class, in addition to programming and generative art, is
a discussion on what NFTs (and maybe blockhain) technology is, how to
create an NFT, how to get setup with a cryptocurrency wallet and how
to transact with cryptocurrency, etc.

The final project would be to create a piece of NFT art that would be
put up on site for sale.

Each instance of the class will focus on an aesthetic theme to help
focus the students direction.
For example, the theme could be "grids", "flow fields", "recursive grids",
"perlin noise lines" etc.


| Unit | Theme | Scope | Time |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| 0 | Introduction | Introduction to generative art, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, programming, Javascript, drawing library (p5.js). Setup of development environment and creation of a 'hello world' generative art piece | 2hrs |
| 1 | Basics of Programming | Exploration of core concepts of programming (variables, loops, conditionals, functions) and how to create the 'skeleton' of the art piece. Prog| 2hrs |
| 2 | Polish | Investigate how to personalize and polish the art piece by adding randomness, unique elements, outside art, etc. | 2hrs |
| 3 | Show and Critique | Students should present their piece for discussion, help, problems, solutions and critique | 2hrs |
| 4 | Final Preparation | Students should work to finalize their piece and get it ready for release | 2hrs |
| 5 | Cryptocurrencies and NFTs | A review and further discussion of what cryptocurrencies are, what NFTs are and how to setup and use a wallet. Students should have a wallet setup with funds available to publish their own NFTs in a marketplace by end of class | 2hrs |
| 6 | Publish | After a discussion on the marketplace mechanisms, logistics of what it means to 'publish', and decisions on what pricing and marketplace to use, students should publish their NFTs on a marketplace | 2hrs |
| 7 | Gallery | Students will display their art to the local community in addition to a discussion of lessons learned, feedback about the process etc. | 2hrs |
