Color Notes
===

Harmonies
---

Use the basics of color groups to help.

* Monochromatic
  - one color
  - small differences to build up library
* Complementary 
  - take opposite colors (2)
* Split Complementary
  - one color with two on opposite offset side
* Triadic color
* Tetradic
  - focus on one main color and use others as accents
* Analogous
  - two to four colors next to each other in hue
  - use one with the other as accent


60-30-10 rule
---

Use the primary 60%, neutral 30% and accent 10%

Contrast
---

Use grayscale to help determine whether your picture has enough contrast.

The lightness is the primary determining factor to differentiate your focus
elements from the background.
Using grayscale can help you figure out if the lightness from your foreground
is differentiated enough from your background.

Start Small, Grow as Needed
---

Use 2-4 colors initially.
If that's not enough, add more.
