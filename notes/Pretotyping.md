| Name | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Fake Door | Test the Initial Level of Interest (ILI) in a yet-to-be-developed product or service by creating artifacts that suggest that the product exists and it’s available to see if people would buy it. | Would anyone order McSpaghetti at a McDonalds? Don’t cook a single strand of pasta! Put McSpaghetti on the menu (either in a store or online if applicable) and see if anybody orders it. If someone orders it, say that it’s not currently available, apologize and offer them a free burger instead. |
| Facade | Test the Initial Level of Interest (ILI) in an existing but not yet broadly available/scalable product or service by creating artifacts that suggest greater availability (or scale.) | Would people buy used cars online (in late 90s)? Bill Gross bought some ads in a newspaper advertising CarsDirect, a new way to buy cars online. He had no car inventory, but created a simple website to see if people would actually go for it. When people clicked on a “buy” button, he bought the car at retail and delivered it to the customer. Over a week-end he sold a few cars. He lost money on every transaction, but validated the business model for his idea. |
| Pinocchio | Create a non-operational version of your product and use your imagination to pretend that it actually works to see if and/or how you would use it. | Jeff Hawkins created a wooden version of the Palm Pilot to test two key hypotheses: 1) Would I carry something with this form factor (i.e. pocket-sized) around? 2) What would I use it for? He learned that the form factor was just right and that he would use it primarily for calendar, address book and simple note taking. |
| Mechanical Turk | Before making a major investment in designing and building a complex mechanism or back-end, consider using human skills to simulate the desired outcome. | IBM tested if and how people would interact with a speech-to-text computer by simulating the actual hardware and software using a hidden typist. The users, were given a microphone and a monitor but no keyboard; when text appeared on the screen they thought that their commands were being processed by a computer, not a person. |
| YouTube | Through the “magic of movies” you can make products that don’t yet exist come to life and see how people react to them: Are they intrigued? Interested? Will they sign up to learn more or, better yet, commit to buy? | Google Glass was first introduced to the world via a YouTube video that showed not what the actual glasses looked like, but what the world would look like through the glasses. People who found the vision (pun intended) of Google Glass compelling had an opportunity to signup and pay $1,500 to receive an “Explorer Toolkit.” This way, before producing a single consumer-ready Glass, Google was able to gage Initial Level of Interest (ILI) and gain other valuable feedback. |
| Provincial | Before committing to launch a new product or service formally and publicly on a large scale, test it in a smaller, more private and informal context to see if people are interested in it. | BestBuy pitched a tent in one of their store parking lots and advertised locally for a new service (tentatively named NextPlay) to see if people would be interested in swapping old electronic gear in exchange for store coupons. It worked, and the service is now available in all stores (and not in tents!) |
| One-night Stand | Offer a pretotype version of you product or service on a very limited time basis to see if there is any interest before making any any long-term commitments. | Sacrificing their own apartment for one night, Airbnb founders created a simple website in which they offered an alternative to hotel rooms: An air-mattress + simple breakfast for $80/night (a bargain in San Francisco.) Much to their surprise, 3 people signed up very quickly and they collected $240 on their first night. Airbnb is now valued at over $10B! |
| MVP | Create a first iteration of your product with the absolute minimum set of features that would make it valuable and useful–at least to early adopters. | The first version of the iPhone did not support cut-and-paste, i offered a very limited number of apps, it did not support notifications or the über-popular Microsoft Exchange email back-end; and it required iTunes to activate/use it. But people wanted it so much that they did not care about the missing functionality–a great indicator of interest. |
| Infiltrator | Take advantage of the customer traffic in an existing store (brickand-mortar or online) to stick an artifact of your idea (it could be a one off, even an empty box) on the shelves to see if people would buy it. | With a used employee shirt bought on eBay to look like an IKEA worker, Upwell Labs’ founder sneaked in a few prototypes of his new product into an IKEA store and put them on display to see if people would buy them. They did! He proved that his new product would sell in a store ... without owning a store. |
| Impostor | Use an existing product or service as a starting point for your new product. Most new products or services are not completely new and different from existing ones. Many times there are other products and services that are close enough and, with some work, can be used to impersonate the new product you have in mind.  | Tesla’s Elon Musk took an existing car (a Lotus roadster) that was close enough to the all-electric roadster he had envisioned, ripped off the internal-combustion engine, put an electric engine in it (along with slightly different body) and drove it around. Now he had an artifact, a really sexy and fast one, to show around. People were obviously interested in the new car; but would anyone be interested enough to buy one? He needed data not opinions. So he asked people who expressed interest if they were interested enough to write him a $5,000 deposit check to be on the waiting list for one. |


Note that these methods should be used with extreme caution as they're essentially engaging in fraud by promising
customers a product that doesn't exist.
I don't think this is necessarily bad, under certain conditions.

For example if the pain of not delivering is minimal to the end customer or a best effort approach
to delivering a product that closely matches what was promised is made or done, this could be fine.
If a small down payment is made and then refunded or if an initial payment is made with the understanding
that the product is yet to be built or if a product is purchased from a third and then passed on to the customer,
potentially at a loss, this could be reasonable.

In the above, the "Infiltrator" pattern needs to be used with caution as you might be testing brand identity rather
than consumer desire.
