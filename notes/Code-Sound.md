Code Sound
===

* Notice programmers don't do better in Java or Perl than
  in a randomly generated language
* Syntax isn't intuitive, we need to teach it
* When keywords sound ambiguous, comprehension suffers
* Telling kids a standard way to pronounce code helped with
  comprehension ("x=5" -> "x is 5", etc.)
* A case for agreeing on a code phonology
