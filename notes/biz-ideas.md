Free/libre music aggregator
---

A music aggregator that consolidates free/libre music spread across the internet.

Bandcamp, Soundcloud and Jamendo have options for free/libre content but are hard to
search.
Often searching on other factors, like keyword, music genre, year, location and, most
importantly, license, is either slow, clunky or not at all available.

Even for free/libre services, like Free Music Archive, the search functionality is
not the greatest.

Part of this service would be an easily downloadable database for offline analysis
in addition to a customizable on-site database where custom queries can be ran.
The data might be too large to fit in browser but, in so far as it's able, this
might be an option for quicker and more complex queries.

Analysis on music (meta data) can be run to provide graphs and other visualizations.

Mood Tracking Application
---

A mood tracking application that can rate your daily mood along with any activities you do (much like Daylio).

The data can be stored local to the browser/application with paid options to store offline (and encrypted).
There could also be questionnaires based on current psychological research to try and get more insight
into external factors, predispositions and other factors that could have an effect on mood.

Users could also opt-in to data sharing options, allowing their data to be imported to "quantified self"
type services, like Open Humans, so they can compare their results to others in the community.

In-Browser Electronics Design
---

An in-browser electronics design package.

There are some fundamental features that should be prioritized:

* KiCAD and Eagle import and export of projects
* Easy footprint and schematic module creation along with export to KiCAD and Eagle
* Easy import footprint and schematic modules into peoples projects
* Easy import of whole boards
* Some "a-la-carte" reference structure that allows for easy "blocks" of electronics to be imported
  and wired together into a single circuit

| target audience | electronics designers, electronic engineering students |


In-Browser Papercraft Unfolder
---

An in-browser papercraft unfolding tool (like Pepakura).

This would allow a 3D model to be uploaded, unfolded and separated into strips of polygons for
use in papercraft models.

A 'print-on-demand' service could be provided that offers pre-cut paper that can be mailed out.

|---|---|
| difficulty | medium |
| target audience | hobbyists wanting to make papercraft models |

Music Similarity Recommendation
---

An application that compares a database of songs with each other on a waveform/spectrum level
to give recommendations.

Investigation has to be done to see if this is at all a viable strategy.
One potential idea is to do melody tempo matching.
Another is to compare just the drum tracks.
Something like Spleeter could be used to help further refine the search.
