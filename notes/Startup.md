### [Building Product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C27RVio2rOs)

Michael Seibel founder of YC, JustinTV

* Founding team is technical
* Burn rate low
* Ego ties to success of startup
* Focus on problem not solution
  - common mistake to talk about solution rather than what problem (market) solving for
* Problem should be 1-2 sentences
  - can't articulate problem (takes more than 2 sentences), don't understand the problem
* Helpful if have problem yourself
* Can you solve problem narrowly
  - due to limited resources, need to target initial audience
  - narrow customer targeting allow for traction
* Is problem solvable
  - maybe problem hasn't been solved because conditions don't allow for (easy) solutions
  - narrowing customer can help get unsolvable conditions this
* Who is your customer
  - most likely not everyone
  - who is ideal first customer
  - talk to your users
* How often does your customer have the problem
  - example: car purchase website:
    + car purchaser has problem 7 years
    + dealer has problem every day
    + customer is dealer not end consumer
  - better to have customer that has problem frequently
* How intense is the problem
* Are customers willing to pay
  - can start to measure how intense problem is by making product harder to use
    and see if customers still use it
  - better to charge more as information from experiment will give you feedback
    about how intense the problem is
* Better metric for problem is high intensity, high frequency
* Talking to bad customers is bad
  - companies can get hijacked by bad customers
* How easy is it to find customers
  - if customers are hard to find, need solution for customer discovery upfront
* Does MVP solve problem
  - through iteration or pivoting, MVP might have stopped solving problem
* Iterate quickly for MVP
* Required step is to give MVP to customers
* Startup world is unforgiving to 'artists'
  - product is not a piece of art that should be appreciated for it's own sake,
    it's a product meant to solve a problem
  - determining whether the product solves the problem is better than thinking it
    should be appreciated for it's own sake
* Often, answers to questions will hurt
* How do you find initial customers:
  - MVP is bad. How to find people will use bad product.
  - 'desperate' users will put up with bad MVP
  - who's business is going to go out of business without you
  - investors are almost never (initial) customers
* Once there are initial customers, identify bad customers
  - overloading support, causing disproportionate allocation of resources
    for solving their specific problems
  - don't let bad customers lead you astray
* Can structure discounts into sales
  - can offer discounts based on third party deals (ex. free AWS usage, offer discount if purchased in first 30-days)
  - discount allows for acceleration of decision making while still defaulting to sustainable pricing
* Analytics:
  - Google analytics too coarse because it's page views and not intra-pay analytics
  - identify which fine-grained interactions users are using in pages
  - pre-requisite for analytics
* Pick 5-10 key analytics to focus on
  - pick names that make sense
* Analytics are key elements of product specification
* Product cycle:
  - have key performance indicator (KPI) and track them for all features/products developed and deployed
  - customer charges -> KPI == revenue, free usage -> KPI = usage based metric (recurring customer usage)
  - brainstorm
    + every idea goes up on board
    + rank easy/medium/hard
  - most hard ideas can be restated by restating as easy idea (or broken down into easy ideas)
  - rank ideas by difficulty in each easy/medium/hard category
    + rank each of by their estimated impact on KPI and difficulty
  - write specification in detail
  - only meeting during product cycle (2-week time) (2+ hour meeting)
  - helps keep cycle 'fun' by deciding on what to work on, not getting derailed while working on them
    and allow for discussion at appropriate times
* CEOs are there for morale (not shooting down ideas)
* Pivot == changing customer or changing problem
  - should be rare as pivoting is a effectively a new product and might be better under a new business
  - 2 year timeline is reasonable time for this type of experimentation
  - pivoting every two months is too frequent
* Iterate == changing solution
  - iterating should be common
* Don't be 'fake Steve Jobs'. Be 'real Steve Jobs':
  - first iPhone had a bad user experience (compared to today)
  - Steve Jobs iterated every year based on customer need
  - fake Steve Jobs thinks their idea is good by their divine inspiration without any feedback
* Helpful to charge customers as soon as possible if the revenue comes from customer payments
  as it's harder to go from free to charging and charging earlier in company life-cycle will
  help determine viability
* Even if KPI is 0, should still track it (and feel bad about it non-increasing)
  - get around it by tracking other numbers that you think might contribute to KPI
    and try and move those numbers (return usage, etc.)
* Mistake in pre-sales is discounting as it's easy to get wrong
* Not levelling up your lifestyle can help position yourself for startup lifestyle (low burn scenario)
* Create a process in your company that can build MVPs quickly
  - technical team is a requirement/almost surely needed for this rapid iteration
  - easier to measure results of experimentation than to have insight into what will work a-priori
  - have to have 'big picture' imagination for where things will be in 10 years but for tactical
    moves, need to be nimble and iteration quickly based on experimentation
  - only swinging for home-runs is deleterious to success


### [How to Find Product Market Fit (YC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LNQxT9LvM0)

Weebly  is a no-code (?) website builder

* Press spikes are almost completely transient, with a burst in sign-ups that level off,
  often with a small bump afterwards
* Product market fit (PMF) can be observed when traction starts scaling exponentially
* Product Market Fit == "Make something a lot of people want"
* Phases: Idea -> Prototype -> Launch -> Traction -> Monetization -> Growth
* Monetization is easier than PMF
* Initial product market fit search is between "idea" and "traction" phase
* Idea to traction is hardest and where most startups fail
* Still refining PMF from monetization and through to growth
* Two most challenging aspects are finding PMF (most startups fail at this)
  and building a world-class team. Distant 3rd is monetization
* Later challenge is after PMF and (during) scaling, building organization that scalably and
  repeatedly launches great products
* Best companies will create market
  - Market research doesn't help as market research is on existing markets
  - Find hidden need (if obvious would be obvious and others would be doing)
* Companies are pulling you towards research, regardless of what you think your product is
  (double down on where customers are pulling you towards)
* Initial product will seem to fit into existing market but with less functionality.
  Customers will/should be pulling you towards functionality incumbents don't provide
* Talk to customers
  - listen to problems not their proposed solutions
  - rapid prototyping
  - test solutions with customer base
  - iterate
  - can expect 30+ iteration cycles
  - no one gets it right on first shot
* Steven Jobs famously said he didn't talk to customers. True but Jobs listened
  to customers problems and tried to find solutions. iPhone and other products
  were initially bad and kept getting better through iteration
  - Don't be 'fake Steven Jobs' and think that you have divine inspiration for
    solutions. Steve Jobs/Apple iterated constantly and listened to customer pain to
    provide solutions even if he didn't (claim to ) rely on market research
* Don't search for 'home run' (completed) products to find fit
  - Rely on mockups to quickly test hypothesis
  - Don't worry about scaling until you need to
  - Don't shy away from monetization but focus on working product
* "Usually take 10x number of iterations than you think it is"
  - keep burn rate low
  - build team that can do this quickly
* Outsourcing is an expensive iteration step and why local teams should be
  preferred as they can iterate quicker and cheaper
* Test solutions with customers 
  - talk to target customers
  - be open to changing opinion on who target customer is
  - don't "overthink" solutions
    + better to try with an imperfect test than to pontificate about correct solution)
    + looking at data (reserach. etc.) only gives you imperfect information, better
      to test and adjust accordingly
* 5-10 customer interviews (1hr, phone, in person interview)
* 3-5 UX testing sessions
* Never get sample size as big as you want so should be wary of extrapolating from small
  sample sizes
* UX testing sessions
  - Observe usage (in front of you)
  - encourage open and honest feedback (hard because users won't want to be cruel)
  - ask user to perform task
  - absolutely don't talk, help or otherwise interfere during during test
  - 3-5 tests will uncover most critical usage issues
* Should strive towards minimum remarkable product
* Don't launch until you have a product that's better than what's out there but
  as soon as you have it, launch
* Prioritize only PMF
  - blog posts, conferences, etc. are superfluous to this task
* Optimize for learning
  - most advice centers on sorting by cost/difficulty x benefit
  - better metric is sorting by biggest unknown in priority list
* Metrics to notice product market fit:
  - return usage: day 1,3,7,30 retention
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS) > 50
    + 'Would you recommend this product to a friend' (0-10)
    + 9-10, promoters, 0-6 detractors, 7-8 thrown out
    + NPS = promoters - detractors
    + initially can be negative and probably where it will start
* Churn is not as important as people think (churn / total)
  - churn can look lower during growth than it actually is
  - renewal rate is better and is (eligible subscribers who renew)
* Pay attention to return usage vs. signups
* All conversion rates are usually low and should not be given too much weight
* PMF is achieved when things are "easy" (decisions look all right) instead
  of being in a 'slog'
  - reality is usually somewhere in between
* PMF is tactical, other things to consider for startups
  - acquire customers in a differentiated way that scales
  - invent business model without killing traction
* Product Market Channel Fit needed form $100M+ growth ([Hubspot Growth Framework](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/hubspot-growth-framework-100m))
  - PMF but 'model' is broken (charging too much/not enough)
  - channel is how to acquire customers
  - sales force for $200+, no sales force $20-
* Team scaling:
  - don't scale until PMF
  - 20- team before PMF
  - 23-25 flat structure breaks down
  - 23+ when middle management needs to be introduced
  - 23- can be hands on and micromanage to a limited extent
  - 23+ when should not micromanage and rely on delegation
  - 23+ is not optimal for finding PMF
* Pre-scaling (20-):
  - moderate micromanagement is OK
  - should be involved in everythign important and know everything
    possible about customers/prodcuts/market/channels
  - can be nimble and keep advantage over large orgs
  - don't delegate anything important (yet)
* Post-scaling (20+):
  - scale aggressively
  - race to capture market
  - don't double team more than 2x per year
    + company scaling is a form of business infrastructure building and is in itself
      a type of experiment to understand how best to organize the business to capture
      market
    + scaling at max 2x allows for iteration
    + scaling above 2x makes it difficult and costly to course correct
  - structure of business goes through a phase change and management will need to be
    implemented/restructured
* Pre-scaling vs. post-scaling is a discovery vs. execution stage, where tactics
  change based on what phase it's in
  - akin to "multi-armed bandit" strategy
  - akin to successful artists discovery vs. execution (successful artists go on a discovery
    phase then transition to execution, where they take what they've learned for monetary
    success)
* Building brand:
  - don't spend too much on early days
  - foundation of brand is articulate insight on core consumer insight that is ideally
    the same as what your product is built on
* Entrepreneurs discount risk and persist
  - personal take is that people are bad at estimating value of exponential growth.
    Entrepreneurs often have blind optimization but this pays out because of unicorn
    effects of exponential growth, vs. people who only see linear reward for amount of
    energy expended. Persistence creates more opportunity of business success.
* Weebly is "anti-pattern" in that they invested in horizontal functionality that,
  after traction, built vertically
* Most companies won't be able to raise money until early stages of traction
  - large seed money (series A) raises are often from founders who have past successful
    history in business etc.
  - sweat equity most 'common' way to solve chicken/egg problem of getting resources
    available to find PMF
* Focus on customers not competitors
  - chasing competitor features is always at a time lag as you only see it after they've
    launched and invested time and effort into making it available
  - feature which propels you to PMF will make up for rest
  - product has "need" that differentiates product from competitors and attracts customers


### [How to Sell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZi4kTJG-LE)

* Talking to customers is selling
* Early startups should be either building or talking to customers
* Three channels for sales: network/conferences/email
  - use your network to get introductions
  - go to conferences
  - cold emails
* Going to conferences:
  - research who's going and email before conference to see if they can meet for a 30min 'pitch'
  - line up your day with pitches to everyone who will listen
* Cold email structure:
  - Who I am; What we do; Why it's interesting to customer; Ask for interaction even if not interested in sales;
    Give concrete time to chat
  - keep short and to the point
* Sales is about listening
  - calls should be 70% listening
* Be diligent about follow up
  - successful sales can have many emails that haven't been responded to
  - being persistent can not be rude but helpful as customers have a lot of things going on
    that might have caused them to lose focus on the sale
* Value in driving conversation to 'yes' or 'no' as 'no' gives feedback about
  when not to invest any more energy
* Closing:
  - have agreement at the ready to give them
  - YC has open source template
  - don't quibble over minor details
  - close quickly
* The "just one more feature" request is often a 'polite' pass rather than
  a promise of purchase after the feature is implemented
  - best to avoid this and just treat it as a pass
  - exception is if they sign a contract for purchase after feature has been implemented
* Free trial can be a trap
  - does not validate concept
* Sales pipeline should be tailored to number of prospective customers
  - high touch sales can work for 1k customers at $100k each
  - low touch sales for 100k customers at $10 each (by necessity)
* Nudge email follow up in a week
* Early startups often need 'renaissance' reps (vs. 'coin-op' reps)
  - 'renaissance' - can figure out things on their own, can experiment, iterate, etc.
  - 'coin-op' - given a script and all information, can churn through quickly
