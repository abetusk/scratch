Cosmic Mythos
===

These ideas are for an art installation drawing on inspiration
from the Theater Bizarre that will give some background
mythology to the art, decor and other installations.

The idea is that the mythology should be somewhat cohesive
while never being directly addressed.
That is, they should only be referred to and be used to for
artistic inspiration while never being spelled out or directly
addressed.

Overview
---

The idea is that the universe has a variety of old being and civilizations
that have been around for much longer than the creation of earth and
have time spans much longer than a human life and human civilization.

Each of these cosmic entities and cosmic civilizations have various motivations but,
for the most part, are competing for survival and domination.
The majority are apathetic to the concerns of humans and some may even
altruistic but many others want to build power and extract resources
to further their own causes.

This is a "hard science" world view, where there is no faster than light
travel and no time travel.
Any influence that these cosmic entities impart to humans should be
considered in the context of influencing human behavior so that our
solar system is either primed for resource extraction by a later invasion,
contorting human civilization to feed back into the main entities resources,
enabling civilization to be part of a larger civilization or be left alone
for conservatory reasons.

All cosmic entities and civilizations are somewhere above the "type III" civilizations on
the Kardashev scale that can use energy on a galactic scale.

A note on the use of "civilization" vs. "entity".
In my belief, when an organism gets to a sufficient complexity, it's composed
of many different intelligent sub parts that are housed in something that can
roughly be thought of as a single unit.
The divide is rough but the use of "cosmic civilization" will describe a collection
of individual complex entities that often have various degrees of autonomy and
influence on the larger civilization structure.
The use of "cosmic entity" is to denote that even though the entity might be
composed of individuals, they all act with a unity of vision that is better
described as a single entity exerting influence rather than a coalition of
entities working together.

Cosmic Entity Motivations
---

A rough breakdown why they would want to influence human civilization:

* Preservation - shield our solar system as a kind of cosmic "zoo", so
  that life as it evolves is left as untouched as possible that comes
  from a motivation of preservation
* Combination - enable and guide human civilization to be part of a larger
  cosmic civilization
* Terraforming - manipulation human civilization to raze the solar system
  so that the entity or civilization can later come in and easily extract
  the resources
* Conquer - manipulate human civilization to corrupt and contort human
  civilization into an agent of the entity for later use

The time scales are galactic so any "invasion" or resource extraction
will have time scales on the millions of years.
Since the time scales are galactic, it's often easier to seed the
civilizations to have them bootstrap themselves into the desired form
rather than send external resources.

The above don't need to mutually exclusive.
For civilizations, there could be many different agents, each wanting
some aspect from the above list.
For entities, the above motivations could be combined but some will
be mutually exclusive (a malevolent entity probably will want to
terraform and conquer at the exclusion of preservation and combination).

Cosmic Entity Tactics
---

Various approaches for each of the civilizations and entities that could
be employed are:

* Artifact seeding - throw various materials or machines throughout space
  and have them affect manipulation to beings around them. Some types of
  artifacts could include:
  - Biological agents that infect or contort matter or life around them
    to coerce and manipulate the environment
  - Machines that only activate based on certain conditions (combination
    unlocking, detection of intelligence in close proximity, energy
    activation, etc.)
* Cosmic signals, which could include:
  - Information transmission to guide advances or lie about the promise of
    advances to trick humans into the creation of maleavolent machines
  - Subtle physical influence, that could, over the span of millions of
    years help life grow or manipulate complex intelligences into
    subservience
* Cosmic probes, which could include:
  - Artifacts placed on nearby planets to monitor progress of evolution
    in the solar system and potentially influence them in various ways
  - Comets or asteroids that orbit various celestial bodies (e.g. the
    earth) that can monitor, manipulate or communicate with nearby
    human civilization

Themes
---

The effect on humans and human civilizations can be broken down roughly as
follows:

* Enabling Discovery - communication or action from cosmic entities will
  have the effect of promoting scientific discovery
* Religious Indoctrination - either through misinterpretation or through
  coercion, communication and action from cosmic entities is interpreted
  as a call to worship the entities as gods and is interpreted as a call
  to subservience
* Greed - through manipulation or coercion, many people will pursue
  action on the behalf of cosmic entities for personal gain, either for
  short term wealth or health or for longer term promises of power
  or longevity
* Mania - through manipulation, many people will go insane as their
  intellect is subverted by a cosmic entities influence

Each of these need not be mutually exclusive and even supposed altruistic
cosmic entities might engage in any of the above, either knowingly or unknowingly.

For the various forms of influence, especially the religious indoctrination
and mania, different social forms can be used to coerce and groom people
for being receptive to the corruption.

Some forms are:

* Painting, Drawing, Sculpture and Pictures - use of imagery such as fine painting, drawings
  and photography, to captivate audiences
* Plays and Motion Pictures - use of play acting, performances and movies to
  captivate audiences
* Music - the use of music, including recordings on different mediums, live performances
  and audience participatory music, to indoctrinate audiences

The above gives a ham-fisted way of justifying the art installation as any
installation that explores the themes with the above list of media can
be thought of as a window into the "secret/forbidden" knowledge
or as a kind of arcade of competing entities vying for influence
over the audience.

Cosmic Entities
---

Here is described a rough pass at a list of cosmic entities.

These should be considered suggestions or cosmic entity archetypes
and should be altered or others be added as desired.

* Obsidian - the predominant cosmic civilization that is constantly
  fighting with other smaller civilization and entities for domination
  and control. Most of the benevolent artifacts and signals will come
  from them but other agents in the Obsidian civilization could just
  as easily have motivations that are malicious or harmful.
  - signals from distant star stations have been used to seed life on
    earth and can be further decoded with advances in technology
    to both receive the signal but also to decode it
* Ur - a technological based entity using seeded artifact machines to
  try and terraform the solar system for later resource extraction
  - machines will be spawned given enough power and will proliferate
    to further extract resources
  - the motivation for investigating the artifact machines is the
    promise of advanced technology, maybe even with Ur lying about
    promises of power and knowledge
* Moumis - a biological entity using seeded biological artifacts
  to infect humans to turn them into an extension of itself.
  - the environment needs to be changed to be more hospitable for
    it's biology
  - living beings of sufficient complexity will experience mania
    as they are subjucated
* Meshshu - an entity actively hunted by Obsidian, which has seeded
  space with various artifacts on comets and asteroids waiting to
  repopulate itself under the radar of detection from other
  civilizations
  - sporadic signals from passing comets influence humans to
    try and generate a combination of machine and biology to
    recreate the entity on earth

I don't have enough knowledge or imagination to understand the various
dynamics of how something like this existing might play out but
it should be noted that for civilizations that want to exert
influence over distant regions where communication and oversight
is minimal, this is ripe for abuse, akin to the imperialism or
robber barren age of the Americas.
As such, even individual entities part of the Obsidian civilization,
say, could start to branch off and become malevolent to increase
their own wealth and influence.
