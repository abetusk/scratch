[Birkoff algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff_algorithm) to find the set of
permutation matrices that a [doubly stochastic matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_stochastic_matrix)
can be decomposed into via the [Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_stochastic_matrix#Birkhoff%E2%80%93von_Neumann_theorem).

A doubly stochastic matrix can be written as a convex combination of no more than $(n-1)^2 + 1$ permutation matricies.
