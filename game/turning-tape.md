Turning Tape
===

Have a 'turning' box that takes in a tape that plays tunes.

---

In order to progress, you meet various denizens that you need
to overcome with music to proceed.

The denizens block access, give keys, gifts or currency for
every successful challenge/response.

---

| Type | Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| Parrot | Play back tune |
| Beat | Play drum beat |
| Copycat | Will copy the tune you play |
| Chord | Will play a chord from the note you play |

There are different instruments with music sheets that can be fed
as input.

The sheets can be linear, looped, maybe looped with a certain length, etc.

Each song pumped through the instrument can produce different effects.
Some might be environmental, some might influence the creatures on the island,
some might open doors, some might be one time use, etc.

The island is basically a lock and key portion, with different creates that you
can interact with that will give you scrolls or songs that you can then input
into your instrument.

Here are some ideas:

* Birds in different corners of the island play pieces to a song that you can put together
  to unlock something. Each birdsong can be relatively simple but layering them on top of
  each other can produce an interesting tune
* Finding a shopkeeper tune that amuses a shopkeeper will give you a 'one time use' tune
  that awards an ability, faster movement, jumping, flying, swimming, etc.
* Two monsters at separate locations each play part of a tune. By playing one monsters tune
  to the other, they get closer to the other monster and give another tune, which you can then
  give to the other monster. Eventually they meet and play the tune with each other in its
  entirety, giving you the reward
* This can be generalized to N monsters
* A creature plays a small tune from a synth, where you need to not only recreate the (maybe
  simple) tune but also the subtractive synthesis patch that makes it sound like the creature
  (mimic the creature to fool some other creature somewhere else on the island)
* A scroll is given but with notes missing. Fill in the missing notes and play to unlock the secret,
  maybe with some other creature giving a clue as to how to complete the tune
* Play a permuted tune (inverted, reversed, octave shifted, sped up, slowed down, etc.) to unlock mystery
* Use note patterns in a particular key with rules (start on tonic, end on tonic, etc.) to
  progressively unlock maze
* Playing same tune in different key to change it's character (sad to happy, happy to sad, mysterious to
  tense) which can change a monsters state from sad to happy, happy to sad, etc, opening the way or
  giving rewards

So the idea is that understanding the shopkeeper tune will give you a type of currency for that island, which
you can then turn into one time use scrolls that award effects.
The currency might even be a base tune which has transformations that the shopkeeper accepts, allowing for
only a finite amount of currency on that level.

Some music spells always work (say, summoning a boat to hop islands, or teleporting to other locations),
other spells only work once (scrolls), some spells only work in a particular island or in a particular location 
on the island.
