Build it, and it works!  Way low cost (currently $30.)  It comes pre-programmed with a music synthesizer (called \"Thick\") that makes really nice sounds and music and noise.  Other diverse synthesizers available at CornfieldElectronics.com .  An ArduTouch Arduino library is available for programming in more super nice synthesizer features.  The ArduTouch Arduino library comes with many way cool example synthesizer sketches that also serve as a tutorial for making your own ArduTouch synthesizers (which are Arduino sketches).  For those who want to learn more, the documentation teaches the basics of Digital Signal Processing for audio generation (with more documentation to come)).","https://github.com/maltman23/ArduTouch"
