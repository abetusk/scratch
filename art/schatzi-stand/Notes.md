Notes
===

* lower jaw can have two motors, one for angular, other for rotation
  - springs to have compliance
  - 3-4 is ideal but 2 is probably good enough
* each eye needs 3 motors, 2 for eye movement + 1 for eyelid
* 1-2 for eyebrows, can probably get away with one
  - eyebrows should be made of sturdy material and skin can be a thin
    layer that's draped over it
* "neck" mechanism can be done with 3 motors ([see](youtube.com/watch?v=gHBSoUFSHfI))
  - two on either side to get head tilt left and right but also forward/back
    if the attachment points are behind the pivot point at base of skull
  - rotation left/right along center shaft
* Mouth can be done with maybe 8 motors? ([see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Gg-m4QD1o))
  - two on each corner
  - two equipositioned on upper lip
  - two equipositioned on lower lip
  - [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke2lJfY4haM) uses 8 endpoints, 2 motors each
    (up/down/in/out for 6 middle, 2d surface position for mouth corners)
* Might need two more motors for cheek muscles (one each)
