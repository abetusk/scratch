LADSPA Vocoder Plugin Release v0.3

Whats new for v0.3:
You can now change the vocoder bands in real time.

Whats new for v0.2:
Uhh, nothing really, mostly just a documentation update :)

See file COPYRIGHT for information about copyright status of this package.
See file INSTALL for information about how to compile and install this
package.

This is basically an adaption of Achim Settelmeier's Vocoder program to
LADSPA. Really all I have done is wrap his vocoder code in a LADSPA plugin.

Achim Settelmeier's <settel-linux@sirlab.de> Vocoder program can be found at:
http://www.sirlab.de/linux/

There is also a good description of how a vocoder works on the above mentioned
site.

I'll start by admitting that I don't really know how this code works :) I just
somewhat blindly converted it to LADSPA. So I'm sure my description is not
entirely correct. Sometime I'll actually try and figure out how the code works
and perhaps optimize it better. Perhaps you don't know what a vocoder is, but
I'm sure you have heard one before. Vocoders are often used to add a robotic
effect to vocals in music.

This vocoder plugin has 2 AUDIO inputs and 1 OUTPUT (of course). The first
INPUT is the "Formant" signal which is usually someone's voice. The second
INPUT is the "Carrier" signal which is some sort of continuous synth sound.
The "Carrier" signal is modulated to the "Formant".
There are a number of LADSPA controls. The first one is the "Number of bands"
which is how many frequency bands to use (current maximum is 16). The rest of
the controls set the level of each individual band and should have a value
between 0.0 and 1.0. The lower numbered bands are lower in frequency the
higher numbered bands are higher in frequency.


Happy robots use Linux and LADSPA!
